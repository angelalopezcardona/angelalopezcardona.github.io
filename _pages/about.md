Originally trained as an engineer with both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Industrial Engineering, I also hold a Master's in Artificial Intelligence from the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/es). After working for over four years developing software and AI solutions within the energy sector, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Faculty of Informatics of the UPC, in collaboration with [Telefónica Innovación Digital](https://telefonicainnovaciondigital.com).

My research specifically focuses on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and human cognition. In particular, we aim to understand the relationship between these two domains by studying the information contained in cognitive data, with the goal of explaining and improving the alignment of language models with their users.
