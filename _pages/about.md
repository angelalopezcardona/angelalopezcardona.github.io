I hold a Master's in Industrial Engineering and another in Artificial Intelligence, both from the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)] (https://www.upc.edu/es). With over 5 years of professional experience, I have combined my industry experience with involvement in research groups. My earlycareer has been focused on developing software and artificial intelligence projects in the energy sector, leading innovative initiatives. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in collaboration with [Telefónica Innovación Digital] (https://telefonicainnovaciondigital.com), at the Faculty of Informatics of the UPC, specializing in the intersection of Large Language Models and human cognition.
